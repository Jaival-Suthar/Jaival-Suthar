# Profile
I am Jaival, a Software Engineer dedicated to creating impactful and meaningful technology solutions. Currently, I am focused on advancing my expertise in React and Node.js, mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and learning System Design—all while continuously building innovative projects.<br><br>
I actively engage in high-quality educational events, which serve as valuable opportunities for growth and inspiration. My involvement included serving as an Executive Committee Member in the IEEE Signal Processing Society and as a Core Team Member of the Google Developer Student Clubs (now GDG) at Silver Oak University. These experiences have enriched my technical skills and collaborative mindset.<br><br>
Outside of software development, I am an avid reader of non-fiction literature, committed to lifelong learning and professional development. I am keen to connect and collaborate on challenging projects that push the boundaries of technology and creativity. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together.<br>
